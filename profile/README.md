## üåü About BTI Fund

BTI Fund is a revolutionary platform that leverages blockchain technology to democratize access to solar energy in Indonesia. By combining performance-based leasing with decentralized crowdfunding, we're removing financial barriers to solar adoption while creating transparent investment opportunities in renewable energy.

Our mission: **Make clean solar energy accessible to everyone while accelerating Indonesia's transition away from coal power.**

## üåç The Problem We're Solving

Indonesia faces significant energy challenges:

- 61% of electricity comes from coal plants
- 43.2% of CO2 emissions come from solid fuels
- High installation costs prevent widespread solar adoption
- Financing bottlenecks slow renewable energy deployment

With 6.5 GWp of untapped solar potential nationwide, Indonesia has an enormous opportunity for renewable transformation.

## üí° Our Solution

BTI Fund creates a blockchain-powered ecosystem connecting investors, solar clients, and service providers:

1. **Tokenized Solar Assets**: Solar installations are represented as NFTs and fractionalized through our $BTI token
2. **Decentralized Funding**: Projects get funded through our marketplace by retail and institutional investors
3. **Smart Contract Management**: Automated handling of investment terms, performance monitoring, and payment distribution
4. **Performance-Based Returns**: Investors receive returns based on actual verified energy production
5. **Impact Tracking**: Environmental benefits are recorded on-chain as verifiable credentials

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Architecture

![BTI Fund Architecture](path/to/architecture_diagram.png)

Our system integrates:

- **Hardware Layer**: IoT sensors and monitoring equipment on solar installations
- **Oracle Layer**: Secure data transmission from physical assets to blockchain
- **Smart Contract Layer**: Core business logic and financial operations
- **Application Layer**: User interfaces for investors, clients, and administrators
- **Analytics Layer**: Performance metrics, impact calculations, and reporting

### Key Technical Innovations

1. **Proof of Solar Production (PoSP)**: Novel consensus mechanism validating energy production
2. **Dynamic NFT Structures**: Solar installations as evolving NFTs with maintenance history
3. **Automated Maintenance DAO**: System-triggered maintenance through decentralized providers
4. **Carbon Credit Integration**: Direct connection to voluntary carbon markets
5. **Progressive Decentralization**: Path from hybrid model to fully decentralized governance

## üöÄ Traction & Impact

BTI Fund isn't just a concept - we're already making a difference:

- **75 operational sites** with 14.4 MWp capacity
- **3 MWp** directly installed by our team
- **1.68 MTons CO2 avoided annually**
- **25,239 tree seedlings** equivalent environmental impact
- **Key clients** include HSBC, Bluebird, PLN (Indonesia's national electric company)
